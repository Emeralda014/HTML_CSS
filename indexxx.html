                    Words alone cannot describe how deeply hurt I am by your sudden demise. I really wish you stayed long enough to reap the bountiful fruits of your labor. I vehemently know the pain of losing you'll never leave me, but I imagine it will ease with time as I process and get through it but I don't suspect I'll get over it. 
    How can I? How can one possibly get over someone that was there even before you were aware of your existence?
    <p>Daddy, you'll forever be in my heart until the very day it stops beating. I am really grateful that I'm becoming a more realized, caring, sincere, passionate, and empathetic person because of you.
    Still, I would forsake any wisdom for the sake of having you back. I miss you so much.
    </p><p>I love you so much now and forever.</p>
    <p>Rest on daddy!</p>
